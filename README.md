# OpenData_Proyect-Covid-19-
This proyect consists in a chart about all the cases arround the world
there are some types of data:
  - Territory/Country
  - Cases per country
  - Deaths
  - Country code; example SIGAPORE has SGP code.
  
There are plenty of data in this xml so i think i will fill in the chart with some of them instead of the whole data. we will see it 

This is the link of the OpenData XML that we are going to use for our app:
